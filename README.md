# 🤖 AI Product Demo Agent

A smart, voice-controlled AI assistant that delivers live product demos — just like a real sales rep. It listens, responds, navigates your product UI, and provides an interactive experience powered by OpenAI.

---

## 🧭 How It Works

1. User clicks a demo link  
2. AI agent greets the user and shares screen  
3. User speaks naturally (e.g., “Show me the dashboard”)  
4. AI navigates the product, explains features, and answers questions  
5. The session is recorded and a transcript is emailed to the user
